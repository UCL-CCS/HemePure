Notes on using elastic walls with HemePure

- Compile HemePure with LADDIOLET inlets, NASHZEROTHORDERPRESSURE outlets, GZSElastic walls and appropriate cross-terms for edge sites. 
- Input file specifies the elastic stiffness applied to all wall sites
- inputSimple.xml uses a parabolic velocity profile at the inlet, inputAdvanced.xml uses a solution for Wommersley flow in an elastic pipe.

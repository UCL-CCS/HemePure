This folder contains input files for some test cases that have been used for performance benchmarking of HemeLB on various HPC systems. For such tests, the simulations only need to run for a short time to gather data, we often use 5000 iterations. Writing of simulation data to file has been disabled in these job scripts. For most cases, the inputPP.xml file uses pressure inlet and outlet conditions whilst the inputVP.xml file uses file based velocity inputs and pressure outputs. The HemeLB executable needs to be appropriately configured to use these scripts. 

The GMY files needed to run the simulations are too large to be stored on GitHub. Please contact Centre for Computational Science at University College London should you require access to these files. If you have sufficient resources available, you can also attempt to build the GMY file yourself using the voxelization tools available in the HemePure_tools repository (https://github.com/JonMcCullough/HemePure_tools).
